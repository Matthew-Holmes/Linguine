# Notebooks

Instead of using an LLM to produce "on the fly" definitions, these are located by having an internal dictionary, so instances of a specific meaning can be logged.

However this requires locating, processing and parsing such data for each language supported (now only English, French, Chinese), the notebooks here do that for free dictionaries I could find.
